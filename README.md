This challenge is primarily focused on utilizing Plotly and D3 libraries in JavaScript. The objective is to pull in JSON data source, process the data by developing functions in JS, and then visually displaying the data in an interactive dashboard.

The visualization page shows three panes of information: demographic information of the subject, barchart of the samples, and bubble chart.

Index.html file calls the main script, app.js, to retrieve, process, and display the data.
